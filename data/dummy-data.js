Originally used as part of a drinking game in the Edo Period (1603-1868), it grew in general popularity over time, especially with kids. You can hold the kendama in different ways, but your goal is (generally) to land the ball on any of the three cups or on the spike at the top. This toy has had a recent resurgence, and you can see tournaments not only in Japan, but around the world!",
